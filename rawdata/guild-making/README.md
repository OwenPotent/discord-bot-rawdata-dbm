## Guild Maker Discord Bot

Here are some rawdatas that are used in making guilds/servers

## How to use them

- You must have Discord Bot Maker (beta isn't needed, but requires latest mods, check [here](https://github.com/dbm-network/mods))
- Open one of the `.json` files and copy the code
- Go back to the app and create a new command

- `right click` the command and press `Edit Raw Data`
- Paste the code you just copied and press `save data`
- You can change the command line however you want, this is just optional though. If you have no experience with handling these stuff, leave it as it is
- Enjoy!
