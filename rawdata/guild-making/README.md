## Guild Maker Discord Bot

Here are some rawdatas that are used in making guilds/servers. You may use them as you wish.

## How to use them

- Open one of the `.json` files and copy the code
- Go back to the app and create a new command

- You can change the command line however you want, this is just optional though. If you have no experience with handling these stuff, leave it as it is
- Enjoy!
